# PZ Cheeseria Api (backend)

## Introduction
This part of the code will provide the api backend to your Angular UI (client). This is where you will retrieve a list of cheeses and store the purchased items.  

## Getting Started
This project is based on .NET 5.0. You can download and install the SDK [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/visual-studio-sdks).
You may choose to use either Visual Studio 2019 or VSCode to modify the API.

## Build and Run
To start the API, open the Pz.Cheeseria solution in Visual Studio (instructions will differ when using VSCode) and run the Pz.Cheeseria.Api project. 
Once started, a new browser tab will open showing the swagger landing page on URL [https://localhost:5001](https://localhost:5001).
